    <h2>Motherboards are the central location where all parts are connected to in some way. Memory, GPU and CPU are attached directly, other parts connected by cables.</h2>

    <h2>Graphics Cards (also called GPUs) are the component which creates the graphics on-screen. GPUs are much faster in processing than CPUs. Any Monitor or Virtual Reality headset you want connected to the computer will be connected to the graphics card.</h2>

    <h2>Power Supply Units (also called PSUs) are the component which supplies the right amount of voltage/ampage to each component. If your desktop has a loud bang and won't turn on, the PSU probably blew up ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</h2>

    <h2>An SSD or Solid State Drive is basically a large USB drive, that has no moving parts, compared to a traditional mechanical hard drive which a needle writes onto a moving disc. SSDs are a faster but costlier alternative.</h2>

    <h2>There are many different coolers and options for coolers. There needs to be a cooler for your CPU (right) and larger fans (left) take air in and out of the case for delivering airflow to hot components. As well as air coolers being fans, there are also water coolers for CPUs and GPUs with cooling blocks and radiators, and passive coolers which are usually aluminium blocks with copper heatpipes but with no fans attached to assist cooling, hence the name passive cooler.</h2>
